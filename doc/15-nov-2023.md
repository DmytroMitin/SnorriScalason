# Things We Learned (15 Nov 2023 Edition)

## Getting Started is Hard

Small (sbt) errors can lead to big problems. Examples:

- the wrong artifact names leads to mysterious "not found" errors in the code
- naming collisions / aliasing leads to difficult to debug errors
- wrong lib versions can cause confusion
- using a template project is probably the best way to get started, if a template is available (it is for Krop).


## Krop Usage

- Krop is a web framework
- Creating routes to handle basic requests
- Setting development mode


## Sbt Arcana

- Knowing magic like `ThisBuild / scalaVersion` to set the Scala version for everything in a project
- When running an `IOApp`, we need to set `run / fork := true`, or kill the running Java process with `killall`
- Copying from existing projects is always a good idea (or at least the way most people get stuff done with sbt).
